# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index range, resulting in this exception.

The `bugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version of the code, illustrating how to avoid this error.

This example is useful for understanding array bounds and preventing this runtime exception.
